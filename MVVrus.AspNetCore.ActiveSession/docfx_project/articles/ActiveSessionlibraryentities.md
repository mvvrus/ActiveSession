# ActiveSession library entities

The ActiveSession library works with the following entities.

+ [ActiveSession library infrastructure](ActiveSessionlibraryinfrastructure.md)
+ [Active session objects](Activesessionobjects.md)
+ [Active session groups](ActiveSessionGroups.md) (since version 1.2)
+ [Runners](Runners.md)
+ [Runner factories](Runnerfactories.md)

All these entities are considered futher.
