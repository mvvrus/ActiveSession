# Runner factories

*Runner factories* are objects that are designed to create runners. The ActiveSession library infrastructure receives runner factories from the service container. Therefore, runner factory classes must be registered during application initialization in the application services container (AKA DI container) as implementations of the interface that the infrastructure will request from the container - the specialization of the generic interface [`IRunnerFactory<TRequest,TResult>`](/api/MVVrus.AspNetCore.ActiveSession.IRunnerFactory-2.html). This interface has two type parameters: TRequest is a type of an argument that is passed by the application to create the runner, TResult is a result type of the created runner. 

To register standard runner factories, the ActiveSession library has extension methods for the IServiceCollection interface intended for this purpose. How to use these methods is shown in the in the [example of initialization code](Setting%20up%20the%20ActiveSession%20library.md#setting-up-the-activesession-library-services-and-configuration). To facilitate an implementation of custom runners, the library also defines auxiliary classes and extension methods intended for this purpose.
